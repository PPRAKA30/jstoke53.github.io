The VI housing design consists of an opaque top and bottom, with a translucent
diffuser piece at the end opposite the OBD-II connector, between two halves of
the housing. The diffuser does a decent job of spreading the light from the 2
RGB LEDs, although a light pipe may provide more consistent saturation.

We've manufacturing this design succesfully with a MakerBot Replicator 2,
SLA, and most recently, injection molded by contract manufacturers from Silicon Valley, the
materials used were:

* VI Top and Bottom: Bayblend T85 XF-901510
* VI Difffuser: Lexan 3412R-131 (Natural 20% Glass Fiber PC)

## Sources

The original master source files for the 3D design were created in CATIA, which
unfortunately is neither open source nor affordable. We've output the design for
the top of the enclosure, the bottom and the diffuser as STL (triangle) and STP
(solid) files.

The files are all [stored in a Git repository at
GitHub](https://github.com/openxc/reference-vi/tree/gh-pages/mechanical) -
pull requests are welcome!

## Improving Design for Manufacturing

* Decrease mold costs by designing mirror image parts - i.e. the top and bottom
  of the VI shold be identical. As of right now, this is not possible with the
  side ports for USB and 12V power.
* Make the part, and therefore the mold, more modular by creating an
  interchangeable plate on the side of the VI. This plate could
  be changed and swapped for different input/output configurations. For
  example: If down the line we decide to remove the 12V connection to reduce
  costs, we could just create a new plate instead of an entire new VI mold.

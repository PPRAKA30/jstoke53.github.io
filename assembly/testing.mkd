**Bluetooth**

1. Maintain a baud rate of at least 115200 for a sustained 5MB transfer over
   Bluetooth with no transmission errors
1. Push varying amounts of data for 12 hours and record all disconnections and
   transmissions errors
1. Run through 100 connect/disconnect cycles, looking for failures to connect,
   or any instance in which the Bluetooth stack on the CAN Translator becomes
   out of sync.

**USB**

1. Maintain a transfer rate of at least 100KB/s for a sustained 5MB transfer
   over USB with no transmission errors
1. Push varying amounts of data for 12 hours and record all disconnections and
   transmissions errors
1. Verify the CAN translator can be powered via USB when not connected to an
   OBD-II port
1. Verify that the CAN translator can be powered by the vehicle through the
   OBD-II port and also be plugged into an Android device via USB while not
   having conflicting current.

**CAN**

1. Verify that CAN messages can be received from a vehicle or test harness,
   and that the stream can be maintained for 1 hour without interruption.
1. Verify that a stream of CAN messages can be written out to the CAN bus for
   1 hour

**Power**

1. Test that MCU can be put to sleep and power draw goes very low
1. Test that MCU can wakeup on a CAN interrupt and get back to full power,
   record time to wakeup (time to wakeup is on the order of microseconds)
1. External power socket should provide steady 12v
1. External power socket should not provide any power when the MCU goes into
   sleep mode

**Lighting**

1. RGB LEDs must be controllable from software

**Pysical**

1. OBD-II connector can be attached to a vehicle with a reasonable amount of
   force
1. OBD-II connector is robustly connected to the port
1. OBD-II connector takes a reasonable amount of effort to detach from the
   vehicle, but the process does not overly strain the housing or PCB
1. The 12v power cable can be attached and detached with a reasonable amount
   of force, and resists being knocked out of the socket by accident

**Mechanical Design**

1. Designed for injection molding --> Constant wall thickness, appropriate
  minimum thickness material (0.050" for ABS), draft angles, slide
  consideration
1. Robust attachment and mating features between housing pieces
1. Appropriate fit in specified vehicles (Focus, Flex, F-150, Explorer)
